# Equity For All

## VOC Airdrop Program

The Vuser blockchain is free for participation and therefore **everyone will be given 1 VOC**. This single VOC token is designed to last for a billion transactions - that is good for a very long time.

### Eligibility

A user just needs to verify their mobile number and they would be eligible to the airdrop.

### Important Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - There is **no ICO**
> - There is **no payment**
> - There are **no other offers**

The VOC coins are:
- **Utility oriented** - designed for practical use on the network
- **Trustless** - no centralized authority required
- **Valueless** - not intended as a speculative investment

## How Does a Coin Last for a Billion Transactions?

### Transaction Cost Comparison

When compared to Ethereum, VOC would cost **10⁶ less in fuel cost**. That would reduce the cost of overall transaction by an order of a millionth.

Therefore, a transaction on Ethereum which generally costs **0.106 Gwei**, should cost a millionth less on Vuser:

```
0.106 Gwei ÷ 1,000,000 = 0.0000001 Gwei = 1000 Wei
```

### Why Ethereum Depletes Faster

An Ethereum wallet typically depletes in approximately **100 to 1,000 average transactions** due to higher fuel costs.

### Why 1 VOC Lasts So Long

With extremely low fuel pricing, **1 VOC is able to support more than a billion transactions**.

### Real-World Perspective

To put this in perspective:
- An average human life has approximately **2 billion seconds**
- Half of that time goes into sleeping or other subconscious activities
- This leaves roughly **1 billion seconds** of conscious life
- **Even if you make 1 transaction every conscious second of your life, you won't run out of VOC**
